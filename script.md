# Camera Device Management Guide

This guide provides instructions for managing camera devices, including checking udev rules and listing camera devices.

## 1. Check udev Rules for Camera Devices

### 1.1 Find the Device Identifier

To determine the attributes of a camera device, use the `udevadm info` command. Replace `{device_path}` with the actual path of your camera device (e.g., `/dev/video0`).

### 1.2 Search udev Rules

To verify if a udev rule exists for your camera device, search for the device identifier in the udev rules directory. Replace `"your_identifier"` with a specific identifier (such as `idVendor` or `idProduct`) obtained from the previous step.

## 2. List Camera Devices

### 2.1 List All Video Devices

To view all connected video devices, ensure that the required package `v4l-utils` `v4l2-ctl --list-devices`
 is installed. Use the appropriate command to list all video devices.

### 2.2 Get Detailed Information for Each Device

For each video device listed, you can retrieve detailed information about the device. Replace `/dev/videoX` with the actual device path (e.g., `/dev/video0`, `/dev/video1`).



## Notes

- Ensure that all necessary packages are installed to use the commands and scripts effectively.
- Replace placeholders with actual values where applicable.
- Follow best practices for script execution and device management.
